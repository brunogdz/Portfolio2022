# Portfolio 2022

This is the project that I'm doing to develop some projects this year ( 2022 ) and of course update my portfolio website that it's kind of old haha, so basically do some projects and try to post them and put in my website to show to you guys and be a better way to you find them in one place!

## The technology that I'm using in this portfolio

I'm doing the backend with Sanity, it's a platform that I can set some data and the Sanity give me a way to change without change the code, only in Sanity's platform, yeah it is INSANE!
