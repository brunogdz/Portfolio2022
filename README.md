# Portfolio 2022

This is the project that I'm doing to develop some projects this year ( 2022 ) and of course update my portfolio website that it's kind of old haha, so basically do some projects and try to post them and put in my website to show to you guys and be a better way to you find them in one place!

## The technology that I'm using in this portfolio

### Backend

I'm doing the backend with Sanity, it's a platform that I can set some data and the Sanity give me a way to change without change the code, only in Sanity's platform, yeah it is INSANE!

### Frontend

I'm using react \o/ hehe. I'll post some images to show you guys how is currently working this process. 

## Why am I doing that?

Is a good question, but this year (2022) it's been a difficult year I think for everyone, and I'm doing that of course to update my portifolio and have a place to post some projects that I'm trying to learn or trying to practice some technology.

In the future I'll post here in this markdown the order of the projects that I'll do or I did to you guys when this website is done you'll can see if is working the linking and see the projects
